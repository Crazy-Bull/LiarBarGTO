# How to use
There are two main executables: calculator.exe and reader.exe, and one config file: config.txt.
The config file is responsible for setting the parameters of the calculator, mainly the training parameters.
For newcomers, no modification nor generation of the GTO strategy is needed, because we have provided one csv file including the whole strategy generated by the default paremeters.
Execute reader.exe, and follow the instructions, you can find the GTO solution for any possible situations.

# Query code 
The query needs a query code. It's generation is explained in the answer  https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/5116791151 (in Chinese).
For English speakers, here is a simple way to generate the query code:
The odd digits represent the information for the 1st player (first to play), and even digits for the 2nd player (last to play).
The first two digits means the number of "real cards" (cards that fit for the game or Joker) in the starting hand. Of course you do not know the information of your opponent, so replace it with a '?'.
From the 3rd digit, each digit means the number of cards played by the corresponding player (1/2/3). If you are the player, and the card you played is fake, you add this number by 3.

The tutorial of generating the strategy set will be updated soon.
